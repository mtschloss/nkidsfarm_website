Unfortunately, scientists have yet to develop an all-bacon pig.  Until then, we enjoy raising the “Hereford” heritage breed of pigs that are red with white spots, floppy ears, and great personalities.  Because they haven’t had the fat bred out of them, they also taste great.  We raise these pigs year around outside on grass where they love plowing up the pasture.  Like chickens, pigs are omnivores that need a diet with a higher protein content than the sheep and cows.  Their diet consists of whey from a local goat dairy, kitchen scraps, and grain.  After five months, the pigs produce a carcass that weighs ~250 lbs.  We sell full and half pigs and take reservations with a deposit.
