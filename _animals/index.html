		<h2>Animals</h2>
		<div class="blurb">
			Our farm has a diverse collection of animals that act mutualistically to maintain their health and productivity. We raise sheep, cows, pigs, chickens, and bees to produce high quality and energy packed products for members of our community. All of our animals are raised without the use of artificial hormones or growth-promoting antibiotics on the pastures of our 25 acre farm in Dexter, MI. While the sheep, cows, and bees receive a 100% forage diet, the chickens and pigs receive a GMO-free feed that is grown locally and purchased from the <a href="http://dextermill.com">Dexter Mill</a>. Our pigs, lambs, and cattle are processed at <a href="http://dunbarmeats.com">Dunbar's Meat Packing Company</a> in Milan because they share our goal of providing an exceptional experience for our customers. Our goal is to raise these animals in as humane and transparent a manner as possible. We'd love to have you out for one of our open houses to learn more about our animals. For now, feel free to check out the links below to learn more about how we raise the animals and how you can enjoy the great meat, eggs, and honey from our farm.
