We have a flock of ~35 Polypay ewes that are great moms and love to be on pasture munching grass and chewing their cud.  The moms will “lamb” in May and there is nothing cuter than a pair of lambs trailing their mom through the pasture or when a bunch of lambs get together and run laps around their paddock.  Our sheep are 100% grass fed.  During the grass-growing season the sheep move to fresh paddocks each day, they eat stockpiled forage in the fall and hay during the winter.  After a year, the lambs are over 100 lbs and yield a carcass that is 50-60 lbs.  We sell whole and half lambs and occasionally have mutton available from cull ewes.  We take reservations with a deposit for lamb and mutton.  The sheep also provide us with an ample annual supply of wool that we use to make rugs and various handicrafts.  These products are available for sale at various times during the year.
