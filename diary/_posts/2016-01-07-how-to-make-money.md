Everyone knows (or should) that the harder you work on something the more money you receive for it. Or at least that's the way it should work. Well there is one place where that does happen, where the more time and dedication you put into a thing the better off you are.

This place is any county fair around you that has a sheep club. And there are 7 simple steps....

1. Sign up or inform the superintendant that you want to show sheep this year. (It's best to do this the year before if you actually want to do it). They will tell you all the requirements for that particular fair.

2. Buy your lambs. These are usually [suffolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_sheep) sheep but we also sell some of [ours](http://nkidsfarm.com/animals/sheep.html) which you can raise for your market lambs.

3. Raise your lambs. There are several [books](http://www.amazon.com/Storeys-Guide-Raising-Sheep-4th/dp/1603424598/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452014799&sr=8-1&keywords=story%27s+guide+to+raising+sheep) as well as [websites](http://smallfarms.cornell.edu/2010/04/04/raising-and-finishing-lambs-on-pasture/) that give very good advice as well as guidelines for raising them.

4. Train them. Every day (or as much as you can stand) you need to go out there with your lambs and train them. This is best done by walking them as if you were in the show. There are many good [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLv26Q0kp_M) that show you how to show the lamb.

5. Shear them and trim their feet at home. They will need to be [slick shorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFzxyL83VkE) to be presentable for the judges as well as having their feet [trimmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ffU_cBjlsk).

6. Get them ready for the show. About two hours before the show starts they will need to be washed and carded. Wet them down then soap them up and let them dry. When they are just a bit damp but mostly dry card them so that their leggs are fluffy and their back looks straight.

7. Show them! If you've done your work over the last year this should be the easiest (though most nerve racking) part of the whole buisness. And if you've REALLY done your work you SHOULD win 1st place.

Now you're asking "how does this get me any more money than if I do a slapdash job of it?" I'll tell you, first: the winning lambs get placed higher on the auction bill and buyers will pay more attention to them and you. Second: because if you do a good enough job you might end up in reserve champion or grand champion spot and [those people](http://chelseaupdate.com/carter-and-mason-trinkle-lamb-show-winners-at-the-chelsea-community-fair/) can get up to $25 a pound (or more) on their lambs. Just think, a 120 pound lamb times $25 a pound is $3000.
