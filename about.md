**ABOUT US**


We have been living in Dexter, MI since 2009 on our 24 acre farm. We have 8 kids: Mary (14), Patrick (12), Joe (10), John (8), Ruth (5), Jacob (4), Peter(2), Martha (a couple of  months). We work as a team to raise animals on pasture. We're especially proud of our flock of Polypay sheep, herd of cattle including Jersey dairy cows and steers and Belted Galloway beef cattle, flocks of hens and meat birds, sounder of Hereford pigs, and swarm of honey bees. Most of these animals are available throughout the year to feed our family and yours! Feel free to explore our website and reach out to us if you have any questions.
